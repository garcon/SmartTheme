# Release v2026-01-27

Date: 2026-01-27

Summary
- Tests and CI: fixed Pester tests and updated mocks to use approved verbs and reference unused parameters so `PSScriptAnalyzer` reports no findings.
- Tools: added `tools/run-local-checks.ps1` to run pinned Pester (v3.4) and `PSScriptAnalyzer` locally.
- Logging & localization: improved UTF-8/BOM handling and added automatic log trimming to reduce repository noise.
- Refactors: small changes across `lib/` to improve DI (`-Config`) and add `ShouldProcess` to state-changing functions.
